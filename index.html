        <h2>Welcome to Undersea Talk Blog</h2>
        <p>Hello dear reader. You have graciously taken your precious time and energy on planet earth to direct your attention to the words I have written. For that, you have done me an eternal kindness and I hope to reward you for that kindness with whatever wisdom I have gained from my time on this earth. This is a multi-page blog outlining history, my life philosophy, moral principles, ponderances and theories and a concrete vision for the future that I would like to build and how I plan to build it. In this document, there are business ideas, stories, and predictions for what the future holds for humanity. I hope you enjoy reading it.</p>
